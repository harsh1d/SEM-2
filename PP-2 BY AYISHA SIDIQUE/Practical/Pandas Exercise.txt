Create a pandas series from list, numpy array and dictionary.


After defining the above series assign them index.

Create one dictionary 
{'name': ['Vinay', 'Kushal', 'Aman'],
'age' : [22, 25, 24],
'occ' : ['engineer', 'doctor', 'accountant']}

and convert in dataframe

Combine multiple series and form one dataframe.



Sample DataFrame:
exam_data = {'name': ['Anjali', 'Divya', 'Dhruv', 'John', 'Rishi', 'Saumil', 'Manan', 'Dhara', 'Kevin', 'Rahul'],
'score': [12.5, 9, 16.5, np.nan, 9, 20, 14.5, np.nan, 8, 19],
'attempts': [1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1],
'qualify': ['yes', 'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes']}
labels = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']

1. Get the first 3 rows of a given DataFrame.

2. Select the 'name' and 'score' columns from the following DataFrame.
3. Select 'name' and 'score' columns in rows 1, 3, 5, 6 from the above data frame.

4. Select the rows where the number of attempts in the examination is greater than 2.

5. Select the rows where the score is missing, i.e. is NaN.

6. Select the rows where number of attempts in the examination is less than 2 and score greater than 15.

7. Change the score in row 'd' to 11.5.

8. Calculate the sum of the examination attempts by the students.

9. Calculate the mean score for each different student in DataFrame.

10. Append a new row 'k' to data frame with given values for each column. Now delete the new row and return the original DataFrame.
Values for each column will be:
name : ‘Suresh’, score: 15.5, attempts: 1, qualify: ‘yes’, label: ‘k’

11. Sort the DataFrame first by 'name' in descending order, then by 'score' in ascending order.

12. Replace the 'qualify' column contains the values  yes' and 'no' with True and False.

13. Change the name 'Dhara' to 'Liza' in name column of the DataFrame.

14. Delete the 'attempts' column from the DataFrame.

15. Add, multiply, subtract and divide  two pandas series.

Numpy exercises

1. Swap rows and columns of a given array in reverse order.

2. Create a 4x4 array, now create a new array from the said array swapping first and last, second and third columns.

3. Create a array of shape(3,4) consisting of elements from 1 to 12.
Replace 4 value with 14
Replace all the elments which are smaller than 5 with 111.
Replace all the elements which are greater than 7 with 1111.

4. 

Given array:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 0]]
New array:
[[3 0 3 0 3 0]
[7 0 7 0 7 0]
[3 0 3 0 3 0]
[7 0 7 0 7 0]
[3 0 3 0 3 0]]

5. Write a NumPy program to create a 4x4 array with random values, now create a new array from the said array swapping first and last rows.
 
import numpy as np
nums = np.zeros(shape=(5, 6), dtype='int')
print("Original array:")
print(nums)
nums[::2, ::2] = 3
nums[1::2, ::2] = 7

6. [[1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
 [1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
 [1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]]

7. [[ 0.  1.  0.  1.]
 [ 1.  0.  1.  0.]
 [ 0.  1.  0.  1.]
 [ 1.  0.  1.  0.]]  

8. Write a NumPy program to create a vector with values ??from 0 to 20 and change the sign of the numbers in the range from 9 to 15.
print("\nNew array:")
print(nums)
Sample Output:

Q.1 Create a DataFrame for Hotel using Pandas with following attributes:

Index:Day, Total_Customers, TotalBill, Number of Tips :Columns

 

a.     Print top 3 and bottom 2 values of data set

b.    Print the information about column and its data types

c.      Print the details max, mean, count and all using describe function

d.    Print unique values of each feature

e. Apply the same exercise for any two datasets you have worked previously
